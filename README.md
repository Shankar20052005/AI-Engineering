# My First Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) – MNIST Digit Recognizer

A beginner-level deep learning project using PyTorch and Google Colab to visualize how Convolutional Neural Networks process images.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the core concepts of CNNs using the MNIST dataset. It focuses on visualizing feature maps after each convolutional layer, helping beginners understand what features the model is learning.

## Features

- Loads MNIST handwritten digit dataset using `torchvision`
- Defines a simple CNN with two convolutional layers
- Visualizes feature maps after each layer
- Implemented in Google Colab using PyTorch

## Dataset

- Dataset: [MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images
- Grayscale handwritten digits (0–9), 28x28 pixels

## How to Run

1. Open `cnn_mnist_visualization.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Run each cell step-by-step
3. Visualize the input image and learned feature maps

## Future Improvements

- Add model training and evaluation
- Introduce max pooling and dropout for better generalization
- Extend to multi-class classification
- Apply to colored images or a custom dataset
