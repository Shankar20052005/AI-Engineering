My First CNN - MNIST Digit Recognizer
This is a beginner-friendly Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project implemented using PyTorch in Google Colab.

Project Overview
Loads the MNIST handwritten digit dataset

Passes images through two convolutional layers

Visualizes feature maps from both convolutional layers

Provides step-by-step explanation of CNN architecture and internals

Dataset
This project uses the MNIST dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0â€“9), downloaded using the torchvision library.

How to Run
Open the Colab notebook file: cnn_mnist_visualization.ipynb

Execute each cell in sequence

Observe the input images and feature maps generated by each convolutional layer

Future Enhancements
Add a training loop with accuracy evaluation

Introduce dropout and pooling layers for better generalization

Extend the project to classify colored images or custom datasets
